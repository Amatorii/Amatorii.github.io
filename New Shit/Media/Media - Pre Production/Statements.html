                <h2>Intention Statements</h2>
                <p>I am going to create a video essay about the videogame Dark Souls 3 and its lore. 
                    It will be mainly educational with some opinions and comedy aspects as well. I 
                    feel that Dark Souls has a style of storytelling that is better than other games 
                    and I hope to change people’s opinion without disregarding or insulting a game 
                    that they love as inferior. It will be focused on how Dark Souls tells it its 
                    lore and how, in my opinion, its style is in most ways better than how other 
                    games tell their narrative. I will first show how Dark Souls tells its story 
                    then compare how Dark Souls tells its story in comparison to games like Call of 
                    Duty or The Last of Us. My contention will be that games that tell its story in a 
                    manner such as Dark Souls are better than forcing game play and narrative as it 
                    gives the player more freedom and satisfaction figuring it out. I decided on using 
                    a video essay as it is the easiest way to reach my audience who already watch videos. 
                    Throughout my essay, as I aim towards teens to young adults, I will include comedic 
                    moments and gameplay too keep their attention and to make viewing enjoyable rather 
                    than just a monotone information dump. I hope that people who watch my video will 
                    have a greater understanding of the world of Dark Souls 3 and its story, and I 
                    also hope that they begin to look at how the story is told in other games compared
                     to Dark Souls. I don’t expect or aim for this video to be much more than a passion
                      project and a love letter to the series. This is because most of the information
                       regarding the lore and the theories surrounding the lore, I have gathered about 
                       it has been already gathered by other people who I will refer too. I don’t want to
                        take credit for all the hard work they’ve put in as that is unfair to them.</p>
                    <p>The aim that I want to achieve with my narrative is to change people’s perspective 
                        on how narratives are told in video games by showing how Dark Soul’s style of story
                         telling is better than most conventional story telling in video games. To start I 
                         will give a general introduction to story telling by comparing Movies, Books and 
                         Video Games and how they have their own ways of telling a narrative. I will then 
                         list some examples of games that have really good narratives but have flaws in 
                         their forced gameplay which leads to frustration. I’ll then clarify by point out 
                         that while these games are good at telling stories, they suffer as they force the 
                         player to play the games story instead of the story the player may want to play. To 
                         give an example of a game that doesn’t use this style of forced gameplay I’ll look 
                         at the Dark Souls franchise. I’ll point out the parts that do have some force gameplay 
                         but point out that it’s beneficial to its story instead of detrimental. I’ll also 
                         highlight the fact that the narrative isn’t even important to the actual playthrough. 
                         As the narrative can be confusing and people may think a game with no narrative is 
                         better than one with a narrative, I’ll outline the general story and an example of a 
                         side plot so the audience can get a general outline of the story. After I have finished 
                         showing how Dark Souls tells its story, I’ll contrast that with Skyrim and Metal Gear. 
                         I’m specifically using these series as Metal Gear is notorious for having absurdly long 
                         cutscenes(it hold the record for longest cutscenes in a game and longest single cut scene) 
                         and Skyrim because it’s dialog is often inorganic and mechanical which can detract and it 
                         forces the player to sit through all of it without being able to do much. To finish I’ll 
                         state my contention that video games are better off having a hands-off approach than 
                         forcing the player to make certain actions. </p>

                         <p>My media product will be targeted towards teens to adults who either have played the Dark 
                             Souls franchise either casually or frequently or haven’t and want to learn more about 
                             Dark Souls and video game design. I hope that people who played the third instalment 
                             will get a better idea and appreciation of the world and law of Dark Souls 3. These 
                             games can be extremely vague and cryptic in the information they directly give to the 
                             player and even still they won’t explain a lot about the game. There are also some key 
                             places, characters and events which they don’t even try to explain at all which can be 
                             very confusing as there could a fairly linear and understandable story line that may have 
                             certain chunks missing that would give much needed context. I hope with the help of my 
                             video people can get the foundation they need to begin piecing the world’s story together 
                             and have other links to more videos that explain the lore more if they want to know the 
                             complete picture. These audience members will engage with my product as they most likely 
                             are a fan of the franchise already and want to know more. Seeing areas that they’ve played 
                             through have more context added to them or recognising an event that they thought meant one 
                             thing being confirmed will give them a real sense of satisfaction as it will seem like they 
                             were seeing the world in a completely different way they hadn’t considered before. I also 
                             want to try and use Dark Souls as a examination of how the story is told in video games, 
                             mainly forced gameplay versus free roam and how Dark Souls does both in a way that makes the 
                             player progress through the game almost as if they were on a rail without making the player 
                             feel like they game is forcing them to play it in a certain way or baring them from making 
                             certain actions. This section will be engaging for my audience outlined earlier as they will 
                             think that a game they loved before was even better than they already thought and will give 
                             them a real sense of pride for their enjoyment of they game. I think that posing my view point 
                             to people who already design games for a living and those interested in design will find my 
                             video quite thought-provoking as they will be able to take what I’ve said and use it as a lens 
                             for looking critically at other games.</p>
