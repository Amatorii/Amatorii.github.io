                <p>My first Production Exersise where I use it to talk about the tutorial level of Dark Souls 3. I used it to look at how I would go if I were to use prerecorded clips over me talking.</p>
                    <h1><iframe width="690px" height="420px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KBPvfwRdJQU"></iframe></h1>
                <p>I used a mixture of voice my voice recordings dubbed over gameplay I recorded and the trailer for Dark Souls 3.
                    I also added the sound effect of a character saying "it's beutiful" for comidic effect.</p>
                <h2>Script</h2>
                <p><em>{Launch Trailer Dark Souls 3}</em></p>
                <h3>-Narrator-</h3>
                <p>Dark Souls is fantasy, dungeon-crawler made by From Software that’s famed for it’s difficulty. It achieves it’s difficulty by making a world with numerous enemies that have vastly higher health bars and damage than the player, whilst giving the player few mechanics to combat this disparity. It also differs from other games by not having a traditional tutorial at the start of the game. Whilst games like Skyrim and the Witcher have dedicated tutorials, constant button prompts and hand holding, this is what a new game of Dark Souls 3 looks like.</p>
                <p><em>{Quick run through of Untended Graves}</em></p>
                <h3>-Narrator-</h3>
                <p>Yep, practically nothing. Whilst it may seem that the first area is pointless and in need of a tutorial befitting of its difficulty, it’s design is very purposeful. First you wake up in a very quiet area, with nothing around. It’s here where most players would start button mashing to see how everything works. In this place the player begin can get accustom to the controls and leaves pointers throughout the level to help out. Then it starts with one enemy and progressively adds more. They’re not really that dangerous at all just an introduction to the combat. Then it moves to more enemies and harder ones as the player builds confidence. There’s even a Sega lawsuit as a challenge for more experienced players.</p>
                <p><em>{Clip of Crystal Lizzard killing the player with a rolling attack}</em></p>
                <p><em>{Extreme Zoom in of the lizzard with the line "I gotta go fast" dubbed over with the sound boosted}</em></p>
                <h3>-Narrator-</h3>
                <p>It knows that we as the player aren’t morons and given it’s the third instalment there’s a lot of returning players who already know how to play. And even people new to the series don’t need some mundane explanation from an NPC to tell us</p>
                <p><em>{Freeze and extreme close up of enermy}</em></p>
                <h3>-Text to Speech Bot-</h3>
                <p>WOAH!!!! Watch out Ashen One, He’s got a sword, he’s dangerous, AAAAAH.</p>
                <h3>-Narrator-</h3>
                <p>It begins gradual and gets progressively harder, introducing the player to the world and even encourages them to keep an eye out for details and secrets as keen-eyed players will notice this ally way that leads to a Soul of a Deserted Corpse. It’s specifically designed for the player to explore and test the game in a safe environment, well safe by Dark Souls standards.</p>
                <p><em>{Player admiring the scenery only to be killed by a giant arrow}</em></p>
                <p><em>{Fight with Ludex Gundyr}</em></p>
                <h3>-Narrator-</h3>  
                <p>It builds the players confidence gradually and then to truly prepare them it has a test for the player in Ludex Gundyr. Gundyr is the perfect tutorial boss for Dark Souls, he’s not impossible to defeat but not a cake walk. He has highly telegraphed attacks that aren’t hard to roll through and has a long enough recovery so that the player isn’t hard pressed to get attacks in but not so long so the player can’t wail on him endlessly. He’s fairly bland and a cake walk for Vets due to his ability to be parried but that’s the point. He’s easy for people who have played before as it would suck to be stuck on the starting area for so long and not be able to get to more interesting areas but hard for new players so they can get used to the game. He introduces what bosses are, teaches players patience and not to greed and how to utilise the rolling and once they’ve gotten used to stage one Gundyr he does this.</p>
                <p><em>{Gundyr transforming into Puss of Man}</em></p>
                <p><em>{Player turns to the camera with the line "I'm going to die" dubbed over and the sound when the attack hits boosted}</em></p>
                <h3>-Narrator-</h3>
                <p>This trick was a big shock to both new and old players as he goes from a pretty generic knight character to Demon snake nightmare monster and he does this to nail the style of Dark Souls home. It’s a show don’t tell game, it shows you how to play, it shows you everything you need to beat the game, sure phase two Gundyr is scary and all but that’s it, he’s just scarier. The same trick of rolling through his attacks and attacking when he’s done will still take him and all the other enemies and bosses down as well. You’re given everything you need to know about the game without some drawn out restrictive tutorial and that’s the beauty of the Dark Souls tutorial. Except player stats honestly what is all this, I don’t want to do a PHD on the significance of the luck stat I just want to know how to make big sword do big damage. Why did you make it this complicated Miyazaki???</p>
                <h3><em>-End-</em></h3>
