              <h2>Subtitles</h2>
              <p>Subtitles are frequently used in funny compilations as they are often used to punctuate the ridiculousness of what’s being said / going on. They also can be used to for humour. It’s done by using the text tool and setting how long it’s on the screen</p>
              <h2>Extreme Zoom In</h2>
              <p>Also used for comedic effect by enhancing the joke being told. It’s done by simply increasing the clips size to where it stretches outside what’s being shown. </p>
              <h2>Attaching two clips together</h2>
              <p>Can be used to compare two things being talked about without having to use cuts which may be jarring. In Premier Pro it’s done by placing the clips on top of each other and reducing the clip size, so they show equally</p>
              <h2>Fade to Black</h2>
              <p>Used to signal the end of a video. Done by attaching the dip to black option in the effects tab</p>
