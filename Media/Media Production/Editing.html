              <p>Here is all of the sources of the clips which I used from other people and all of the specialist echniques I used as well including kinds of shots and edits:</p>
              <p></p>  
               <h3>People I Plagiarized:</h3>
                  
                  <p>Soviet Womble - https://www.youtube.com/user/SovietWomble</p>
                  <p>IGN - https://www.youtube.com/user/IGNentertainment</p>
                  <p>MaximumPanic - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1DrV8mz7mhHCT0Ov7e1uEQ</p>
                  <p>VaatiVidya - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe0DNp0mKMqrYVaTundyr9w</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <h3>Music Used:</h3>
                  <p>Inspire - https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/inspire</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I chose this piece for my outro as it was very upbeat and positive as it was the feeling, I wanted my audiance to come away with.</p>
                  <p>Better Days - https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/better-days</p>
                  <p>Sad Day - https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/sad-day</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	Both ‘Better Days’ and ‘Sad Day’ are chosen as I wanted the audience to resonate with the general overall sombre mood of Dark Souls.</p>
                  <p>All That - https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/all-that-chill-hop</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	Same as the outro, I chose ‘All That’ as it was very jazzy and upbeat as I thought that would be the best way to get my audience interested.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  
                  <h3>List of Specific Scenes / Edits:</h3>
                  <p>Intro:</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	Done in person so they can put a voice and name to a face. It also makes me more relatable as they know what I look like which adds a sense of familiarity, making my content more appealing as I seem more trustworthy.</p>
                  <p>Background clips:</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	A lot of the clips that won’t be specified are chosen because I’ve mentioned them by name and am giving the audience a confirmation of what I’m talking about or for a similar reason as the aforementioned, but I didn’t mention their name. Almost all of them are widely known</p>
                  <p>Examples of Poor Game Design:</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	The moments used are also from popular games and I specifically chose examples that the audience will be able to relate to. The first is a prime example as it an example of a restrictive tutorial which a lot of gamers are often frustrated by as they just want to play and don’t want or need a tutorial. I also chose clips that were funny as humour is one of the consistent tones throughout the video and prior humour can help make further jokes more funny as it’s hard to stop laughing once you start.</p>
                  <p>Beating on NPC with voice over:</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	I included this edit to show the frustration that players feel when subjected to bad writing</p>
                  <p>Killing All Dark Soul’s NPCs:</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	To prove my point, I show me killing all the NPCs in Dark Souls aside from the 4 mentioned previously. It’s inclusion is also to add more humour to keep the audience interested.</p>
                  <p>Interviews:</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	The general purpose of this scene was to show that you could play Dark Souls and not know that it had a story. To do this I asked one of my friends who had played the game to show that even though he had played it (a fact which the audience knows is implied, therefore removing the necessity of justification) he didn’t know what the story was. I also showed an interview with my mum as a comedic touch. While my mum has played the Dark Souls series, the implied humour is that ‘Of course your mum doesn’t know the story of Dark Souls as she probably hasn’t every touched a video game with a ten-foot pole.’ This is evident from her general confused responses and makes it funnier as the audience think that she has no idea what I’m talking about and find her confusion funny as she’s presented to be out of her depth.</p>
                  <p>04:00 – 04:10:</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	This sequence is added to include more humour. This is first evident from the photo of the 4 lords and Sith who the people who have played Dark Souls will know why he’s included but to others, he doesn’t need to be explained as the only people who would notice him or look for him in the photo would be people who have played the game. The template used is the Ginyu Force Pose, a pop culture meme that people will find funny as these serious characters are portrayed as being silly by having their likeness portrayed onto silly characters. In the same vein, the depiction of the convocation between the lords and the Dragons is also meant as satire.</p>
                  <p>04:53 – 05:31:</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	This whole scene is also meant as satire. As I spiral from asking relevant questions to going on a rant about unrelated topics. As I get further and further from topic, the comedic tone is also signalled as things get more and more absurd. I go from showing in game photos to showing memes (which Dark Souls fans and my general audience will understand), to crude edits of serious characters made to look wacky. This culminates into me talking about a recent political event, Joe Biden playing a meme that is considered dead as he wants to seem relatable. I’m able to make the audience laugh by saying what it is they’re thinking as in Joe’s attempt to make himself appear like he knows pop culture, it’s illustrating further that he has no idea what he’s talking about. The final meme punctuates this as it’s a distortion meme. The eccentric nature of the meme and the absurd amounts of edits made to the photo is done to put a spotlight on how hard Joe is trying to seem funny to a teenage audience, whilst further cementing him as someone unaware that his actions have the inverse effect.</p>
                  <p>The Final Fantasy X scene</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	This scene is a mixture of me showing an example of how bad stories can be in games and shit-posting for comedy’s sake. For those unaware, the overall ludicrous nature of the scene will be further punctuated by the numerous edits I made which highlight the scene’s flaws, making it twice as funny to them than if I just showed them the scene by itself. And for those who know the scene, the edit will help them sit through the scene again as if I just played it, they’d be likely to skip or leave as the scene is only really funny the first time around or out of context. </p>
                  
                  <h3>List of Shots (Note: Time Stamps are in referance to the video):</h3>
                  <p>Mid Shot - 00:08</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	The most commonly used shot in my production. I used this as the default distance just as a general rule of thumb for consistency’s sake.</p>
                  <p>Close Up - 00:39</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	For clips that I made, I used it for comedic effect. For this specific clip, I chose it as it was able to best illustrate a story in a short amount of time. The close up on the character’s face shows all the emotion and conveys it easily to the audience. I wanted a clip like this to show the audience an example of storytelling in games.</p>
                  <p>Slow Pan - 02:09</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	I chose a slow pan as to accommodate the more sombre tone I was going for.</p>
                  <p>Low angle - 03:55</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	Done to give the audience a subtle hit as to Gwyn’s importance. </p>
                  <p>Establishing Shot - 04:13</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	I chose this shot as to quickly show the audience what Anor Londo looked like</p>
                  <p>Extreme Close Up - 05:07</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	Done here for comedic effect, same with close up</p>
                  <p>Eye Level Shot - 05:14</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	Positioning the unsettling character at eye level is done to force the player to look at him as he is where their eyes to default to. By making them look at him, they’re meant to see how ridiculous he is and his inclusion sets up further jokes as being more funny as the previous clips helped get them in the mood for humour and inspire them to already start laughing so sequential humour will seem more funny than if they were shown on their own.</p>
                  <p>Full shot - 05:19</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	Done to show the body</p>
                  <p>High Angle Shot - 05:20</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	Done to make the subject seem vulnerable</p>
                  <p></p>

                  <h3>List of Editing Techniques (Note: Time Stamps are in referance to the video):</h3>
                  <p>Standard Cut / Fade to Black - 00:04</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	This was used as just a simple transition. If I wanted to transition clips or topics without jarring the audience then I’d use this technique. If I just used plain cuts, it would be very unsatisfying for the audience</p>
                  <p>Jump Cut - 00:05</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	Used in a similar way to the Fade to Black but if I didn’t feel the transition needed to be smooth. These cuts were a lot more fast passed</p>
                  <p>Montage - 00:36</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	A general staple of these sorts of video essays. They include a montage of clips that have reference to the topic being talked about or the clips shown are being directly referenced by the narrator. Both examples are used as they give the audience a visual aid and clarification, so they know for sure they’re on the same page as the writer.</p>
                  <p>J Cut - 01:38</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	Done to try and ease the audience from the quick showcase back to me talking. I chose this technique in the same vein as the Fade as I didn’t want to jar the audience</p>
                  <p>Continuity Error - 01:52</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	Bit of a stretch as it’s not the conventional continuity error. I did this as I wanted to play the clip again in slow motion with subtitles saying, “Are you good bro?” for comedic effect.</p>
                  <p>Slow Motion - 01:54</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	Read above</p>
                  <p>Cut to Black / Smash Cut / Cutaway - 01:58</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	Done to signal to the audience that my argument is going to progress, and the tone is about to change. It’s also done to make the previous clip more jarring to try and make it more comedic</p>
                  <p>Fade from Black - 2:03</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	Done to set the tone for the middle section of the video as a more sombre, calmer section to try and stimulate the audience to think more deeply about narrative and to make my points about how Dark Souls more compelling as the quieter tone helps the points seem more calculated and thought over.</p>
                  <p>Fade in/out - 02:04</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	Just wanted to quickly show the title to give those who don’t know what I’m talking about some reference and to spark those who have heard of Dark Souls but need help remembering what it is as to prepare them for the following discussion.</p>
                  <p>Invisible Cut - 02:25</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	Done to make the transition more smooth</p>
                  <p>Zoom - 03:38</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	Done for comedic effect</p>
                  <p>Match Cut - 05:09</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	Same as above</p>
                  <br>
