                <p><b>Camera:</b> I only had a few live action camera shots in my production. My intro and the shot where I was interviewing my mum. It’s mainly because if I were to make my production in this style, I would be restricted in the kinds of skits I could do. I could also give the audience a better idea of what I was talking about if I used actual footage and it allowed me to easily set the tone and help immerse the audience in what I was talking about. In some of the in game footage, mainly the Dark Souls clips, I did have to use the games 3rd person camera for most of it as my only other option was to use the binoculars which would’ve been more trouble than it was worth as it would’ve made the footage clunky. I was able to still frame all of the shots in the way I wanted. I just had to lower the camera, so the subject was to my avatars left or right. There was one exception which was when I used some footage from another YouTuber who I referenced in my description but forgot to include a text as to which clips were his. But it’s easy to tell what was his as all of his clips were filmed when he was in noclip with his character model turned off. Noclipping in video game lingo is when you remove your character’s hit box so you no clip through the terrain. In this mode you can also completely control your character’s trajectory to freely move on the x, y and z axis when usually you are bound by the game’s movement system. Unfortunately given the game breaking nature, this feature is only available through mods and as I only had access to the console version, I wasn’t able to attain said mods. But if I were the shots, I would use would be nearly identical to the ones used as the atmospheric tone they have is what I wanted to convey and accompany my voice over if I did have access to those resources.

                  <br>
                  <b>Lighting:</b> For my live action shots I didn’t have overly complicated lighting as I didn’t feel it was necessary. I just had my curtains closed with my room’s lights on and my desk lamp pointed towards the wall to make my face a bit whiter.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Background Clips:</b> All of the clips I used were based on what I was talking about and the tone I was trying to set. This is demonstrated in the shots where I used a recording of a boss fight in addition to my voice over. I wanted to do an information dump in a way that wasn’t boring but still relevant. By having action balance the overall monotone mood section of the video helped make it feel not boring as even if what I was saying wasn’t interesting, the accompanying video made it as they could focus on that while also listening to what I was saying. This is also the case in the more comedic sections as I wanted to make the video a bit more than just a boring opinion piece and I used those funny moments to balance the serious moments, but tried not to force them too hard as that could hurt the video as a whole. A section where I may have messed this up a bit is in the Joe Biden section the switch from explaining Dark Soul’s complex narrative to taking a dig at Joe Biden’s poor campaigning decisions may have been a bit jarring and seemed out of place.

                  <b>Recording / Acting:</b> This posed the biggest challenge aside from the monotony of editing which was inflated by having to listen and look at myself over and over again. I don’t like how I look in photos as if I try to smile any bigger than just a pencil smile, I either look constipated, trying too hard, like I’m being tortured or all three at once. I also don’t have an extensive acting history and I’m not an eccentric extroverted person, so I didn’t have the energy to make my performance really interesting by itself (thank god for the music.) All of these problems were made worse as I realized that when ever I record myself, I my eyes look tilted by a 20o angle. Also, I have a tendency to adlib, which would be fine if I also didn’t have dysgraphia. This meant I had to spend a lot more time recording as I’d be reading the script, think of a better way to phrase the sentence or change a word, continue changing the script to try and make the whole thing make sense, get stuck up on one word and then start stuttering like a faulty car engine (Reference see 00:29.) I also had to change cameras as the one I had originally borrowed died, so I just used the camera we had but I didn’t know we did. When reading my voice overs, for some reason my mouth was always very dry which meant occasionally, it’d sound like I was smacking my lips which was very distracting. I’m really bugged about my performance as I defiantly think that it’s the weakest section of the video. Whether it’s my monotone voice, my stage fright, my ill arranged and lack lustre mis en scene, the lack of a proper recording booth and my acting inexperience it’s definitely the part of the video I would’ve redone if given a chance with better conditions. At least I got to use my nice waistcoat and linen shirt.

                  <br>
                  <b>Editing:</b> From what I think was the weakest point to one of my stronger. I had never used Adobe Premier Pro in my life and the only real video editing experience I had before (excluding my first production exercise) was a 5 minute Minecraft video I made 6 years ago when I was 12, that didn’t record my friends speaking so I just sound crazy, was just me jumping around, has 100 views and 2 dislikes and I misspelt sure in the end graphic. Needless to say (aside from some rough parts and terrible clip quality) I was really happy that I was able to go from no idea what I was doing, to making a 10-minute video that had decent editing. Three parts which I feel exemplify this the best is with the clip of me interviewing my mum, the Joe Biden distortion meme and the Final Fantasy scene. I was really happy with the edit I did as the zoom in and the animated subtitles worked a lot better than I thought. I was also happy with the Joe Biden meme as it had 5 moving parts which I had to animate by hand individually, along with the whole visual oversaturation / noise. It’s much the same with the Final Fantasy clip as even still I still chuckle when I watch it over again. I also think overall the tone was consistently what I wanted it to be for the better or worse which I’m really proud of. There were a few hiccups. First is with the two clips of in game dialog with the Shrine Handmaiden and the Fire Keeper and my Discord interview with Flynn. I think for the first two I did have audio but it wasn’t in sync and was laggy but I couldn’t find the original clips but I know for certain that Premier Pro messed with the clips frame rate as in the original video, the audio and video are flawless but, when I put them in Premier, I get depression. I don’t know what to do to fix it, all the other clips are fine but for some reason this one clip just decides to have a seizure. On the topic of Premier Pro being an “industry standard application,” apparently, this industry standard application couldn’t render the audio and video together and always, no matter what I did, no matter what type of file I exported it as, always corrupted it. It was either the audio, the video but never both. What fixed was after trying and failing to use the Windows default video editing tool (another mistake I should’ve never considered as it managed to completely mess up the video quality and desync the audio and frame rate) When I put the audio and video back in Premier Pro, it fixed it. I don’t know why it wasn’t able to do it the first time, but thankfully it did it so it was decent, I’m still really annoyed, my first render I set all the setting so my video and audio would look as good as they could, it took me 45 minutes and used all of my 1,500 computer’s processing power and I couldn’t even use it.

                  <b>Sound / Music:</b> I didn’t have too many sound effects as the majority of my video was based around me speaking. Originally, I was expecting the music to sound quite terrible as I would have had to rely on royalty free music and usually there’s a reason why it free. But thankfully I found Bensounds.com which solved any music problems as not only did they have an extensive music library that covered almost any genre I could’ve used but it also didn’t sound half bad. For the first section of my video I used a more upbeat track to try and get the audience to feel excited and upbeat. I chose a jazz swing song which was a better decision than originally anticipated because of its beat and composition, I was able to perfectly match a cut away to the end of one of the song’s beats that sounded really satisfying. However, I did make one mistake which was that I didn’t keep my voice over’s audio consistent so in some parts it’s louder than others. I also found that my voice tended to overpower the music which was kinda a bummer as I put a lot of effort into finding the right tracks. If I could do a re-edit, I’d probably make sure that my voice and the overall volume was consistent.

                  <b>Unused / Removed aspects:</b> I briefly outlined all of the changes, but I’ll go into more detail here. Generally, unless I adlibbed or forgot to include that part, the majority of my changes were either due to time constraints, or script / shot re-writes. I definitely would liked to have done almost a complete rewrite of some parts as I think my script isn’t as good as it should be and doesn’t convey my opinion correctly and in the way I wanted it to but it’s whatever. I did manage to make some changes to try and salvage it, but I still would’ve liked a second go. This confliction definitely hurt the final product as evident from my overall dissatisfaction towards the video, but I think I managed to still do a decent job with what I gave myself to work with.

                  <br>
                  <b>Conclusion:</b> This video, holistically, is what I wanted it to be but it’s still not exactly what I envisioned. Thankfully Covid didn’t interfere with things too much, the absence of in class discussion may have hindered the overall quality but even without Covid, the final product would’ve been much the same. I also will quickly mention that my original production schedule, while feasible if I had of been at my best mentally, didn’t account for the fact that sometimes I just procrastinate for a whole day. My production diary wasn’t as intricate as I would’ve liked it to be, but it’s still did get the general brushes of my production. Now onto my video, some parts turned out better than I originally thought like a lot of the voice over parts, I think the editing and the clips are both really good. I also like the majority of the shit-posting sections, especially the Star Wars edit as, despite being one of the first things I finished, it’s still one of my favourite parts. The editing, clips were two of the stronger areas along with the music. I definitely would’ve liked to have done the live and voice acting parts again as they’re some of the worse bits of the video along with the script. I didn’t really like the script, as evident by the many changes, and would’ve liked to have changed it after some more thinking and research. I also find the quality a bit irritating as it’s very pixelated and not as good as it could be. Though that could be in large part to Premier Pro. Overall I’m fairly happy with the product and have learned so much than I originally thought and if given a second chance, I know I would be able to make a video that’s much better than this.
