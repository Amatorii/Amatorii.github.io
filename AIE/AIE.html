                <p>Hey, here's the first build of our game. It's a psychological horror survival game but right now there's no jumpscares so if you don't do well with horror you shouldn't be too scared. Click the button and you'll get a .rar file that'll download. You will need a .rar unpacker like win rar or win zip. Once you unpack the file you'll get a folder called Unity Game and inside will be an .exe called Version Delta, you only need to use this. Double click it and it'll launch the game, note you will need headphones to play the game. All you need to do to win is complete the mini game on the screen by using the wasd keys for moving and space to jump, you have unlimited lives so you can't lose so don't worry about dying. Though keep an ear out as you'll get an unwelcome visitor. If you don't wish to die then you can use your flash light on him with rmb (right mouse button) but be conservative or else you'll run out and will be vulnerable. Once you complete the 2D game you'll win. Right now there's only 1 level and an undetermined amount of monsters in the game but we'll add more. This is our first build so don't expect GOTY material or a finished game in any stretch of the imagination. Once you finish the game if you could please fill out a survey below to give us feedback on the game. Also this is important: <b>If you find any bugs, game breaks or exploits in the game let us know.</b> Thanks for helping us, we'll let you know when new builds are out if you want to help us with further testing.</p>
