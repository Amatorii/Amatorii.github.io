                    Narrator: 
                    Movies, books and games. All 3 have 1 main thing in common, they are all used to tell stories. That being said, they all have their own ways of telling stories. Movies are generally good for telling shorter stories with use of visual and audio accommodation. Books makes use of the readers imagination, using words to spark an image in the audiences minds and are able to tell longer stories with a greater build-up. And games, as they are the longest form, often tell a collection of many stories with an overarching narrative for the player to follow. But while Movies and Books have a set story, games are capable of telling 1000 stories in one title depending on the game’s replay ability. Games like GTA 5, Skyrim, Far Cry and Sekiro are key examples of two players playing the same game and having completely different experiences and endings. But while all 3 are master pieces of storytelling, they all do share a common problem.
                    {Far Cry 3’s Restrictive tutorials, Sekiro’s unbeatable first boss, GTA’s Quest parameters and Skyrim’s Invincible NPCs}
                    They all force the player to take various actions because it is important to the story. It’s similar to Plot Armor and Dumb decisions made by characters in Movies and Books. And like Movies and Books, it’s a result of bad writing.
                    {Clip of Player beating on Farkas in Skyrim with the sound overlay of Maximum Panic screaming “JUST. FUCKING. DIE”}
                    An example of a game that isn’t plagued by invisible walls, mandatory quests and invincible NPCs is Dark Souls 3. Dark Souls 3 has almost no force gameplay aside from some invincible NPCs like Andre, Ludleth, the Fire Keeper and the Shrine Handmaiden as if any of these NPCs were to die, the player would lose the ability to buy items, infuse boss souls into weapons and spells, infuse or upgrade weapons and Estus Flasks and level up so essentially their current game would be ruined . It also makes sense from a narrative point of view, both the Shrine Maiden and Ludleth are undead and the Shrine Maiden says after you kill her {“I am undead. Bound forever by the Shrines curse.”} so it’s possible that Aundre and the Firekeeper are also bound by this curse and the fire keeper even says as well {“But, know’st thou not? I cannot die.”}  Aside from that, you can kill literarily anyone you meet.  Depressed Man, Onion Man, turtle man, giant man, every man, and woman. Speaking of the narrative, Dark Soul’s narrative is purposely deceptive and cryptic. This works in its favour as if you don’t really care about the narratives…

                    Narrator:
                    You don’t even need to know it. Though for those who are interested in it, it’s not hard to uncover.  Just by going off the intro cut scenes at the start of the 3 games we learn the main story. Originally the world was grey, dark and ruled by dragons. But one day fire was born and eventually the 4 lords, Gwyn the Lord of Sunlight, the Witch Izalith, Nito the Lord of the dead and the Pygmy lords.  With their powers combined they said, “nice world dragons, it’s now ours.” {Text to speech bot} And killed almost every dragon and thus birthed the age of fire.  But as time passed, a new threat was born, humans who were branded by the Dark Sign. These humans once branded are eternally cursed to seek fire and fated to eventually become hollows, beings that feed upon souls.  And as the years went on the age of fire began to fade and as desperate attempt to save it, the old lords are risen to rekindle the flames, Aldrich the Saint, Farron’s Abyss watchers and Yhorm the Giant. But these lords abandoned their duty so as a last resort, the unkindled ash, undead who failed to link the flame, were summoned to seek the lords and return them to their thrones. But even still, there are questions can be raised.  Like, what happened to the original lords and why weren’t they summoned?  Where did the hollows and the Dark Sign come from? What happened to Anor Londo and Drangleic? What’s the Abyss and where did it come from? Why am I so alo…

                    And that’s sort of the fun of Dark Souls. There’s answers but not all questions have answers that can be found. The game works a lot like history. We can theorise to fill in gaps, do as much research as we like, put two and two together but sometimes we’ll never have the completed picture, the puzzles with missing pieces and mazes with no end or prize.  A good example of this vague lore is with Dragon Slayer Ornstein. Ornstein was a knight of Gwyn and sworn to Gwyn’s first born and assigned to guard Gwynivier. But one day he left his post, in search of the of the first born who had disgraced himself and was thus cast from the annals of history and we only find his armour on the ground at arch dragon peak.  We aren’t explicitly told anything else but looking at everything we know; we can make several educated guesses.  We know that he was sworn to the first born as his “faithful First knight” and we find his armour where you defeat the Nameless King.  From this we can tell that Ornstein sought the First Born order to ally himself with him as he is clarified to be faithful and in a game starved of information, specifications like this are often important,  we can also tell that the Nameless King is Gwyn’s first born as he wields a spear akin to Ornstein’s and Ornstein’s set is found at Arch dragon peak, the possible end of his search.  This is essential how the lore works, we’re given tad bits of information to the point that we want more and we are able to form a general picture but not enough so players know everything and can make their own theories and assumptions about what happened, which gives the player a sense of ownership and satisfaction at decrypting it’s secrets. This style is very different to other story driven games like Skyrim and Metal Gear franchise who delivers their stories like this. 
                    {dialog scene with Jahrl Balgruff discussing the dragon with the solider from Skyrim at the appropriate speed as to not bloat the video}
                    {A clip from longest scene from Metal Gear Solid 4 where nothing is going on and eventually the text comes on the screen reading “This goes on for 71 minutes” for 2 seconds before disappearing and an audio dub of Jon Tron saying “well that was a load of shit” with an extreme zoom on a character’s face}
                    Narrator:
                        While some people may enjoy this kind of story telling
                    {Cut back to the MGS4 cutscene with the sound boosted and another close up on a character doing nothing}
                    It’s not the best utilisation of video games as a medium. Movies utilise dialog, sound and scenery, Books utilise the readers mind and Games should utilise the players innate curiosity to spike their interest in the world through cryptic information that leaves them wanting more, whilst giving them the freedom to play the game however they like. 
                    Narrator: 
                    Hey, thanks for watching till the end. I understand that I may be misconstrued as hating some of the franchises I dissed, I don’t actually hate any of the franchises I talked about, I just think that there are better ways of story telling in games. I also would like to give a shout out to Vaatividya who deserves the majority of the credit and is also a great channel if you want to listen to something and want to learn more about the Dark Souls lore. I also have all of the links to the videos or movies I used in the description. I hope you enjoyed and make sure you get your 8 hours.
